# HCI-room-project
### For Prof. Nathan Prestopnik's Human Centered Interfaces classes
Was tasked with creating a control panel that controls the lights, doors, windows, and temperature in the room as an intuitive and easy to use system. 

Coded in Javascript, focusing primarily on principles of UI and usability principles.

Originally coded in Fall 2015. Periodically updated when I need to look impressive for job hunting.
